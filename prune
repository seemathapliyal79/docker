# Pruning is  cleaning up unused objects (often referred to as “garbage collection”), such as images, containers, volumes, and networks: 
these objects are generally not removed unless you explicitly ask Docker to do so.



# By default, docker image prune only cleans up dangling images. A dangling image is one that is not tagged and is not referenced by any container.

docker image prune                                 ### prune only cleans up dangling image
docker image prune -a                              ### To remove all images which are not used by existing containers
docker image prune -a --filter "until=240h"        ### removes images created more than 10 days (240h) ago:

docker container prune                                 ### prune stopped containers
docker volume prune
docker volume prune --filter "label!=keep"              ## docker volume prune --filter "label!=keep"           
docker network prune



docker system prune                           ## shortcut that prunes images, containers, and networks. Volumes are not pruned by default
docker system prune --volumes                 ## To also prune volumes with system prune, add the --volumes
